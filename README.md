## Running the sim

There is (yet) to be much customizations for the sim thru command line options.
You will need to get your hands wet and edit sim/main.go to customize the sim for now.

Out-of-box, you can run the following command
```shell
go run sim/main.go -logtostderr -v=50
```

It is preconfigured with below
- rules from a certain partciular real-world casino
- CSM Shuffling (emulate some props from a popular CSM model) 
- player that uses a simple hilo counting strategy adapted for counting CSM
- player also sizes bets according to the running count

Note that logging makes the sim much much much slower. If you want to the sim to run faster, then 
```shell
go run sim/main.go -logtostderr -v=40
```
